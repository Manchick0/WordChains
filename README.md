# Word Chains

Word Chains is a simple, yet interesting game with one main objective. That is getting from an inital word to the target one.
Both initial and target words get chosen from a predifined list, meaning you'll never face any difficulties.

# How to play?

Head over to the [website](https://manchick0.github.io/WordChains/), and start typing with either your own keyboard, or the one located on the page. The word you've typed in must differ from the current one by exactly one letter. If this simple condition is met, you'll be able to continue your game. In case the entered word is invalid, you'll see it glow either red or yellow.
Red glow means that the word doesn't exist in the dictionary, whilst yellow appears if the word is too far off from the current one.
